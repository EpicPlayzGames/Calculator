# Python Calculator
This is a basic python calculator I made while learning python using if and elif statements for control flow

Made within a linux environment. If you wish to use this for whatever reason, this can be downloaded from:

`https://github.com/EpicPlayzGames/Calculator/archive/refs/heads/master.zip`

or using 

`git clone https://github.com/EpicPlayzGames/Calculator.git`

open a terminal or powershell and ensure you have python3 or higher using `python --version`

To run this, navigate to the file location using `cd (file_path)` and then execute the command `python main.py` 

Have fun! `~EpicPlayzGames`
